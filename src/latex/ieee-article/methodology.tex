% shows how to enumerate items if you ever need to
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Here you write about step 1.
	\item Here you write about step 2.
\end{enumerate}

% NOTE:
% Enumerate only if it makes sense.
% Depending on the field of work, researchers may (or not) use a list to
% detail the experimental procedure. If you write in an organized manner
% you will not need to use lists to describe what you did.
